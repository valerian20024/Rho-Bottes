Discord Bot using `discord.py` librairy. Intended for personal use, but might give inspiration or help others.

Create a file 'discord_token.py' at the same level as 'main.py' and write your token in the form :
`TOKEN = "tokenWrittenAsAString"`

Be in src/ for launching main.py. Paths to files are relatives, must get this to work better.
